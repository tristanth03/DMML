a.
The accuracy of both data sets is 100%. The reason for that is that the means are 
so far apart and the standard deviation low, so there are very slim chances that a data point of the distribution
N(-4, sqrt(2)) will be mistaken to be N(4,sqrt(2)).

b.
i - When you Increase the no of data points then the accuracy will still by very, very high 
but the accuracy will approximate to the distribution.

ii - When the means get closer then the accuracy will decrease but 
When the means get further away then the accuracy will increase.

iii -  When the standard deviations get larger then the accuracy will decrease but 
When the standard deviations get smaller then the accuracy will increase.
