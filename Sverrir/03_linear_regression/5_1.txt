These predictions are ok but not that great. We see that the actual target values cluster into three clusters 
but the predicted values cluster into 2 clusters and the predicted values sigificantly underestimate the 
actual target values for values greater than 1. However the model captures some aspects of
the actual target values but it is far from being optimal and in order to get closer we need to tune tune
lamda even further so it improves.














The current model captures some aspects of the target values but its performance is far from optimal. 
The significant differences between actual and predicted values, especially in higher ranges, 
indicate a need for further tuning and model evaluation.
