    Multivariate Normal Basis Function
    The function transforms (possibly many) data vectors <features>

    data vectors.
    * mu: [MxD] matrix of M D-dimensional mean vectors defining
    the multivariate normal distributions.
    * var: All normal distributions are isotropic with sigma^2*I covariance
    matrices (where I is the MxM identity matrix)

    * fi - [NxM] is the basis function vectors containing a basis function
    output fi for each data vector x in features
