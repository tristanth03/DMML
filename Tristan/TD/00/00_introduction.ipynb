    "# Introduction Assignment\n",
    "This is an introductory assignment for the course. By solving this assignment you will get more familiar with the tools we will be using in the course.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solving this assignment is not a requirement and will not be a part of your final grade, but is helpful to get you started with the tools you need to be able to use during future assignments in this course.**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setting up\n",
    "Before starting, make sure that you have installed Python requirements as explained in the [main README](../README.md).\n",
    "\n",
    "All your code should be turned in as a python script, i.e.\n",
    "* A single file with a `.py` ending. Although you can use the `template.ipynb` notebook in your development and then port your code over to `template.py` if that suits you.\n",
    "* The file should contain all the functions with **exactly** the same function names as listed in the assignment description below\n",
    "* Use the supplied `template.py` file to fill in your code\n",
    "* Plots should be turned in as well. The naming convention for submitted plots is as follows: The Z-th plot under Part X.Y should be turned in as `X_Y_Z.png`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "You will need the following requirements to finish this requirement.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `numpy`: https://numpy.org/\n",
    "- `matplotlib`: https://matplotlib.org/\n",

    "You can run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all the requirements.\n",

    "### 1.1\n",
    "Define the Gaussian probability density function `normal_prob(x, sigma, mu)` where:\n",
    "    * $\\sigma$ is the standard deviation\n",
    "    * $\\mu$ is the mean of the distribution\n",
    "    * $x$ is any real value\n",

    "* for $\\pi$ do: `np.pi`\n",
    "* for $e^2$ do: `np.exp(2)`\n",
    "* For multiplication/division you can simply use `*` and `/` respectively.\n",

    "### 1.2\n",
    "Define a function `plot_normal(sigma, mu, x_start, x_end)` that plots a normal distribution on the given range, [x_start, x_end]. This function should work similarily to `examples.plot_multiple` in that it should only plot onto a figure without actually showing it. Inside the function, create 500 linear spaced values using `np.linspace`.\n",

    "### 2.1\n",
    "Create a function `normal_mixture(x, sigmas, mus, weights)` which defines a Gaussian mixture function. A Gaussian mixture density function combines multiple gaussian densities with weights that sum to 1. It is given by:\n",

    "### 2.2\n",
    "Lets compare three individual normal components with the evenly-weighted mixture of the three. You should use your `plot_normal` function for the individual components but a different method must be used for the mixture.\n",

    "Define a function `sample_gaussian_mixture(sigmas, mus, weights, n_samples)` that samples `n_samples` from a given gaussian mixture. To sample a Gaussian mixture it is best to do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use `np.random.multinomial` to determine how many times each normal component is selected to sample from. For example, to throw a dice 10 times using this function you would do: `np.random.multinomial(10, [1/6.]*6)` since each side of the dice is equally likely, i.e. $1/6$. In your case, these probabilities are determined by the weights in your mixture\n",
