To start with we can NOT expect the batch estimate to be exactly (-1,2).
Because we have deviations from the data given be the standard deviation.

With n approaching infinity we might expect the estimate to reach (-1,2)
i.e. changing n to a VERY LARGE number will result in a near exact batch estimate of (-1,2).

By simply changing the standard deviation to 0, the estimate will always result as being exactly (-1,2), regardless of n being large.
